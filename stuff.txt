1 our life is shaped by our mind we become what we think
2 suffering follows an evil thought as the wheels of a cart follow the oxen that draw it

3 our life is shaped by our mind we become what we think
4 joy follows a pure thought like a shadow that never leaves

5 he was angry with me he attacked me he deafted me he robbed me
6 those who dwell on such thoughts will never be free from hatred

7 he was angry with me he attacked me he deafted me he robbed me
8 those who do not dwell on such thoughts will surely become free from hatred

9 for hatred can never put an end to hatred
10 love alone can this is am unalterable law

11 people forget that their lives will end soon
12 for those who remember their quarrels come to an end

13 as a strong wind blows down a weak tree
14 mara the tempter overwhelms weak people
15 who eat too much and work too little and are caught in the frantic pursuit of pleasure
16 as the strongest wind can not shake a mountain
17 mara can not shake those who are self-disciplined and full of faith

18 those who put on the saffron robe
19 without purifying the mind and lack truthfulness and self-control
20 are not fit to wear the saffron robe

21 but those who have purified their mind
22 and are endowed with truth and self-control
23 are truly fit to wear the saffron robe

24 the deluded imagining trivial things to be vital to life
25 follow their vain fancies and 
26 never attain the highest knowledge

27 but the wise knowing what is trivial and
28 what is vital set their thoughts on the supreme goal
29 and attain the highest knowledge

30 as rain seeps through an ill-thatched hut
31 passion will seep through a untrained mind

32 as rain cannot seep through a well-thatched hut
33 passion cannot seep through a well-trained mind

34 those who are selfish suffer here and hereafter
35 they suffer in both worlds from the results of their own actions
36 but those who are selfless rejoice here and hereafter
37 they rejoice in both worlds from the results of their own actions

38 those who are selfish suffer in this life and the next
39 they suffer seeing the results of the evil they have done
40 and more suffering awaits them in the next life
